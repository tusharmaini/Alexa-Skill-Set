Activation intent: Alexa, talk to Chase hotels
 
Alexa says: Hi Chris, how may I help you? To get started you can say things like “I want to book a hotel in Paris”
 
I’m fine with location unless Chris has typical location that Chase uses frequently. McLeod?
 
Number of guests: I like this part
 
Alexa says: Great. When do you want to check in?
 
Chris says: November 1st
 
Alexa says: Great. When do you want to check out?
 
Chris says: November 5th
 
I like the preferences section. Question: is Alexa prompting these preferences from the user or is it just a free form list from Chris?
 
Hotel Options section: it would be great if Alexa could remind Chris that there is free cancelation until 4 days before the stay and ask if he would like to book one of the options. Maybe also prompt him that it can be repeated if he wants.
 
For the booking part: I’d like to do the deep link SMS we spoke about on the phone. Do we need to say anything like “price is good for 24 hours” or “prices can change”?
